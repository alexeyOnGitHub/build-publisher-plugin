    Select this box to add test result summaries to the outgoing messages. Note that only <b>"published"</b> test
    results
    will be found by the plugin.
    <ul>
        <li>Native Maven build jobs automatically <b>publish</b> test results, no additional configuration necessary.
        </li>
        <li>Freestyle jobs require <b>additional</b> configuration:
            need to add a Post-Build step to your Build Job(s) called "Publish JUnit test results report"
            (provided by JUnit Plugin)
            with something like "test-reports/*.xml" in "Test report XMLs" field (depending on where your custom job
            saves results).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sample JSon element that will be added to the message:
