<div>
RabbitMQ "exchange" name. This is similar to "queue", but one level higher: once you publish message to an "Exchange",
it will be routed by RabbitMQ to proper queue(s). This field must contain an Exchange name that already exist
on the RabbitMQ server.

See http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-java.html about exchanges.
